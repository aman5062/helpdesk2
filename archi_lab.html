<center><h4>To recognize various component</h4></center> 
Basic computer skills are essential for professionals in all roles and industries. A computer comprises two primary components, namely hardware and software. Knowing the role and utility of different 
computer components can help you improve your computer skills. In this article, we discuss the different components of a computer and share their purpose in the computer system.<br><br>
		
<b>What are the basic components of a computer?</b><br>
Here are the fundamental components of a computer along with their functions:<br><br>
		
<b>1. Central processing unit (CPU)-</b><br>
The CPU is the primary control centre of the computer, and it facilitates communication and collaboration between different hardware and software computer components. It is also usually the most complex and 
valuable part of the entire system because of its complicated design and utility. Without the CPU, the other parts of a computer serve no function. The power supply gives the CPU the necessary energy to process
different operations. CPUs require regular maintenance, like cleaning, dust removal, checking the fan and ensuring that all circuits are connected. The CPU contains the circuit boards, memory and RAM of a 
computer.<br><br>
		
<b>2. Motherboard-</b><br>
The motherboard acts as the central electrical circuit by connecting different parts, distributing power as per energy requirement and delivering information and instructions across the computer system.
The motherboard processes the actual exchange of information and data in a computer system and comprises the CPU, memory and secondary storage devices. Motherboards are very sensitive and may 
malfunction if exposed to high temperatures, pressure or humidity. They require maintenance to check for corrosion and electrical connections.<br><br>
		
<b>3. Random access memory (RAM)-</b><br>
RAM is the memory space that houses temporary data, processes, information and commands. When you launch a program or use an application, it uses the RAM to stay active and work optimally. Different types of 
computers may use different RAMs. The higher the RAM in your computer, the more is its processing power and ability to run various applications simultaneously. In many personal computers and laptops, people 
increase the RAM to complement an update in the operating system or other software. Deleting temporary files and turning off the computer regularly after usage help with efficient RAM utilisation.<br><br>
		
<b>4. Video graphics array port-</b><br>
A video graphic array (VGA) port is a connector usually present in desktops and other display devices. It is typically present on the side or back of a monitor or display screen and helps share the screen or 
visuals with another machine. Special VGA cables may be required to facilitate this sharing. You may also require the VGA port to connect a computer or laptop to a projector. The quality of visuals often depends
on the number of connectors in the port.
Newer video cards may not have a VGA output port, and smaller laptops may also omit them due to their compact design. In such a case, a signal converter may be necessary to connect them to a projector.<br><br>
<b>5. Power supply-</b><br>
The power supply port provides electricity that activates the entire computer system. Usually, the power chord is present at the back of the CPU or the PC tower and goes directly into the electricity socket. Places with variable power supplies may use a UPS or uninterrupted power supply unit to ensure that fluctuations do not impact the computer's performance. Many modern personal computers have in-built UPS units. Laptops operate on removable batteries that require charging periodically. The life cycle of laptop batteries is finite, and their performance decreases after a few years.<br><br>
<b>6. Cooling fan-</b><br>
A computer system or laptop uses electricity to operate and produces heat in the process. All CPUs and laptops have a cooling fan to circulate air in the internal system and prevent overheating. High-end computers may also have more than one cooling fan to ensure that the user can use heavy-duty applications that require high performance from the system. Usually, gaming computers and computers for professional purposes, like video editing and sound mixing, have more than one cooling fan. If your computer is frequently overheating, make sure you check the fan and clean it to remove any debris.<br><br>
<b>7. Hard drive-</b><br>
Hard drives are the storage devices that save the file, information and programs. They are usually magnetically coated discs that store all this data digitally. Hard drives with high storage can naturally save more data. You can also purchase external removable storage devices to manage data more efficiently. Alternatively, you can also move your data to cloud-based storage services and save storage memory on your system. Hard drives are susceptible to failure, and backing up your drives regularly is a good practice.<br><br>
<b>8. Display monitor-</b><br>
The display monitor of a computer is the screen where you can view different programs and operate the system. The resolution and pixel density of a monitor determines its sharpness and quality. The performance of a monitor is usually a top priority for all computer and laptop users. Laptop and computer screens emit artificial light that can be detrimental to your eyes if exposed for long durations without any break. You can affix an anti-glare film on your monitor or wear glasses while using the computer to minimise the effect of this light.<br><br>
<b>9. Keyboard-</b><br> 
The computer keyword is an important piece of hardware used to input text, characters and other important commands. The keyboard contains keys for alphabets, numerals and symbols, alongside having special keys for specific purposes and commands. In many tablets and virtual PCs, the keyboard may also be virtual. Different types of keyboards are available in the market, but most of them have the same set and arrangement of keys. A keyboard can be wireless or wired. Most keyboards also have a backlight to illuminate the keys and enable users to use the computer at night or in low-light conditions.<br><br>
<b>10. Printer-</b><br>
The printer generates a copy of virtual text or images on paper using ink. For example, if you make a text-based report on your computer, you can print several copies of this document. Inkjet and laser printers are the two most commonly used printers. Most leading computer companies also offer printers. Printers require maintenance, which includes regularly replacing ink cartridges and toner, removing jammed papers and cleaning connectors. 3D printers are also available, and you can produce 3D objects using the right code and raw materials.<br><br>
<b>11. Computer mouse-</b><br>
The mouse in a computer is a small device that controls the cursor and gives input to the system. A mouse can be wired or wireless, has left and right click-buttons and usually has a small scrolling wheel to help users navigate a long page. Mouses come in different shapes and sizes and can also be suitable for left or right-handed individuals. They usually require a flat surface to work optimally. Smaller-sized mouse devices are also available for users who want to travel with their computers or laptops.<br><br>
<b>12. System software-</b><br>
A computer has three crucial system software components. These software solutions act as an interface between the hardware and other applications and enable you to use the computer easily. These three crucial system software applications are:
<ol>		
<li>Operating system: the foundational software that runs the entire computer, its programs and applications</li>
<li>Language processor: the software that converts all user instructions into a language that the computer can understand</li>
<li>Device drivers: device-specific software that enables different devices, like a printer or mouse, to function<br><br></li></ol>
		
<b>13. Application software-</b><br>
These are individual software applications that provide specific functions and features. These applications are usually third-party services and can be based on the computer system and stored in the memory or have a cloud-based operation. Without application software, a computer system would have very little utility. Some popular examples include word processing software, spreadsheet software, presentation software, database management software, editing software and other multimedia software.<br><br>
<b>14. Utility software-</b><br>
These are optional but important software components of a computer that help improve its performance, security or utility. These software solutions help manage the computer's memory, files and other applications. They also help customise the interface and desktop, alongside making the computer system safer to use and helping with the recovery process in case of a system failure. Some common examples of utility software applications are anti-virus software, disk management tools, file management software, backup and encryption tools, compression software, disk defragmenter and disk cleaner software.<br><br>

<b>8086 Pin Diagram</b><br>		
Here is the pin diagram of 8086 microprocessor −<br>
<img src="img/pin_dig.png" alt="pin_dig" width="300px"><br>
Let us now discuss the signals in detail −<br>
<b>Power supply and frequency signals</b><br>
It uses 5V DC supply at VCC pin 40, and uses ground at VSS pin 1 and 20 for its operation.<br>
<b>Clock signal</b><br>
Clock signal is provided through Pin-19. It provides timing to the processor for operations. Its frequency is different for different versions, i.e. 5MHz, 8MHz and 10MHz.<br>
<b>Address/data bus</b><br>
AD0-AD15. These are 16 address/data bus. AD0-AD7 carries low order byte data and AD8AD15 carries higher order byte data. During the first clock cycle, it carries 16-bit address and after that it carries 16-bit data.<br>
<b>Address/status bus</b><br>
A16-A19/S3-S6. These are the 4 address/status buses. During the first clock cycle, it carries 4-bit address and later it carries status signals.</b><br>
<b>S7/BHE</b><br>
BHE stands for Bus High Enable. It is available at pin 34 and used to indicate the transfer of data using data bus D8-D15. This signal is low during the first clock cycle, thereafter it is active.</b><br>
<b>$\overline{RD}$</b><br>
It is available at pin 32 and is used to read signal for Read operation.<br>
<b>Ready</b><br>
It is available at pin 22. It is an acknowledgement signal from I/O devices that data is transferred. It is an active high signal. When it is high, it indicates that the device is ready to transfer data. When it is low, it indicates wait state.<br>
<b>RESET</b><br>
It is available at pin 21 and is used to restart the execution. It causes the processor to immediately terminate its present activity. This signal is active high for the first 4 clock cycles to RESET the microprocessor.<br>
<b>INTR</b><br>
It is available at pin 18. It is an interrupt request signal, which is sampled during the last clock cycle of each instruction to determine if the processor considered this as an interrupt or not.<br>
<b>NMI</b><br>
It stands for non-maskable interrupt and is available at pin 17. It is an edge triggered input, which causes an interrupt request to the microprocessor.<br>
$\overline{TEST}$<br><br>
This signal is like wait state and is available at pin 23. When this signal is high, then the processor has to wait for IDLE state, else the execution continues.<br>
<b>MN/$\overline{MX}$</b><br>
It stands for Minimum/Maximum and is available at pin 33. It indicates what mode the processor is to operate in; when it is high, it works in the minimum mode and vice-aversa.<br>
<b>INTA</b><br>
It is an interrupt acknowledgement signal and id available at pin 24. When the microprocessor receives this signal, it acknowledges the interrupt.<br>
<b>ALE</b><br>
It stands for address enable latch and is available at pin 25. A positive pulse is generated each time the processor begins any operation. This signal indicates the availability of a valid address on the address/data lines.<br>
<b>DEN</b><br>
It stands for Data Enable and is available at pin 26. It is used to enable Transreceiver 8286. The transreceiver is a device used to separate data from the address/data bus.<br>
<b>DT/R</b><br>
It stands for Data Transmit/Receive signal and is available at pin 27. It decides the direction of data flow through the transreceiver. When it is high, data is transmitted out and vice-a-versa.<br>
<b>M/IO</b><br>
This signal is used to distinguish between memory and I/O operations. When it is high, it indicates I/O operation and when it is low indicates the memory operation. It is available at pin 28.<br>
<b>WR</b><br>
It stands for write signal and is available at pin 29. It is used to write the data into the memory or the output device depending on the status of M/IO signal.<br>
<b>HLDA</b><br>
It stands for Hold Acknowledgement signal and is available at pin 30. This signal acknowledges the HOLD signal.<br>
<b>HOLD</b><br>
This signal indicates to the processor that external devices are requesting to access the address/data buses. It is available at pin 31.<br>
<b>QS1 and QS0</b><br>
These are queue status signals and are available at pin 24 and 25. These signals provide the status of instruction queue. Their conditions are shown in the following table-<br><br>

When a computer system is turned on it requires a series of initialization and test before the user can work on it. This process is called booting.<br><br>
<b>Basic Input Output System (BIOS) :</b><br>
It provides a set of instructions and is responsible for booting the computer. The BIOS performs all the test needed at startup time. These tests are collectively known as Power On Self Test(POST) .The computer contains hardware like keyboard, monitor, disk drives, etc. there functioning requires interfacing with the operating system. The BIOS provides drivers for basic hardware like keyboard and monitor, mouse, etc. The operating system provides hardware for printer, modem, etc. Drivers for some hardware may not be available in the operating system hence these have to be explicitly installed by the user.<br>
<b>Power On Self Test (POST) :</b><br>
POST consists of a series of diagnostic test that runs automatically when a user turns on the computer. The actual test may differ depending on the configuration of the BIOS. However, the usual test includes testing of the RAM, keyboard and the disk drives. If these tests are successful the computer boots itself and loads the operating system but if these tests are unsuccessful, the computer reports the errors through a series of beeps to draw the operator’s attention and finally an error message is displayed on the monitor.<br>
<img src="img/Table_dig.jpg" id="img1"><br><br>
<b>Location Of BIOS :</b><br>
BIOS is typically placed in a chip known as Read Only Memory(ROM) that comes with the computer. This ensures that the BIOS will always be available even if the hard disk is formatted or replaced. However, in many cases the content of the ROM is transferred to the RAM when the system is started. This is because the RAM allows quicker access as compared to the ROM. Copying of the content of the ROM to the RAM is known as shadowing.<br>
<b>Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor RAM :</b><br>
As the BIOS will interface the hardware with the operating system, it will require configurations of the hardware components like hard disk, monitor, etc. This information is permanently saved in an area known as Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Random Access Memory (CMOS RAM). Power is supplied to the CMOS from a small battery so its contents will not be lost after the PC is turned off. Therefore, there is a battery and a small RAM memory on the board which stores information in a permanent manner. The CMOS needs very little power so there is not much of strain on the computer’s battery. Even then the battery is rechargeable is recharged every time the computer is turned on.
